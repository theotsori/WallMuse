# WallMuse

WallMuse is a modern, Expo-based wallpaper application built with TypeScript. It allows users to explore a grid of wallpaper categories on the home screen and view images in a sleek horizontal swipe view filtered by category. Users can view detailed information for each wallpaper, mark favorites, share, and download imagesâ€”all wrapped in a beautifully animated, dark-themed interface.
